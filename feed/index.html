<p>When it comes to valued flagship Oneplus has made a mark. They were coming close to true flagships sometimes even better than that. To continue their legacy, Oneplus has just dropped their year-end refresh for Oneplus 7 and Oneplus 7 pro with huge variances from the former ones as Oneplus 7t. Let&#8217;s have a look at whats the sibling got inside the box.</p>

<p><strong>Build, Design and Display</strong></p>



<p>The Oneplus 7t carries the same design language from previous generations Oneplus 7 and Oneplus 6t. It has a glass back with circular camera setup at the back and front glass panel with a waterdrop notch. The buttons like the power button and Oneplus alert slider on the right side along with volume rockers on the left side. At the bottom, there are dual stereo speakers(Dolby supported) and a type c charging port, we still lacking 3.5mm jack here. The bottom bezels are minimal and phone weights 190g. So overall there is nothing much change in front panel design but in the back, we could see a big refresh here a triple camera layout. </p>



<p>The Phone still lacking IP certification which we are longing to see on Oneplus device but it can still resist you from spills and splashes. So overall its quite normal as Oneplus won&#8217;t make many changes in design for T series. </p>



<p>The Oneplus 7t has 6.55 inch HDR 10 plus fluid AMOLED panel with 90HZ refresh rate protected by Gorilla Glass. Here the display is slightly bumped up in size from the previous generation but the resolution still remains the same. As usual Oneplus 7 carries an optical In-Display fingerprint sensor for wake up. Trust me the display would be as smooth as butter in Oneplus 7t.</p>



<p><strong>Performance and Software</strong></p>



<p>The Oneplus 7t is running on the Snapdragon 855 plus which is the fastest Android chip on the planet. It&#8217;s running on Android 10 based Oxygen OS 10.0 and it will be the first phone to launch with Android 10.0 out of the box. Also, Oneplus has made India centric software features like dedicated cloud storage for the gallery, improvised cricket scores, work-life balance mode, messages app in organised manner etc..</p>



<p>So snapdragon 855+ with Oxygen Os coupled with 90 HZ Amoled panel will be a cakewalk for UI transitions and one would not make any compliance on the same. It has 8GB of Ram and 128 GB storage as base version and it goes till 256 GB storage. So overall as usual Oneplus 7t is performance beast and easily take over the flagship killers.</p>



<h3><strong>Camera and Battery</strong></h3>



<p>Here Oneplus finally adds the third camera to 7t too. The Oneplus 7t has 48MP primary camera plus 16MP ultra-wide-angle and 12MP telephoto shooter at the back kept horizontally in a circular fashion with a slight bump.  The Wide-angle lens covers the 117-degree field of view and telephoto lens can go beyond 2X optical Zoom. There is software processed macro mode as well which can take as close to subject till 2.5cm. Oneplus has brought some new features like a super steady shot, ultra-wide nightscape etc.. The portrait shots can be captured by both telephoto lens as well as the primary lens to get wider view.</p>



<p>For video, as usual, it has OIS support. For selfies, it still has the same 16MP shooter as we have seen in the past. I would say the selfie camera could have been improvised. Oneplus claims they had improvised video modes to support vloggers.</p>

<p>The Oneplus 7t battery is slightly raised to 3800 MAH with 30W charger and they claim it&#8217;s still 23 percentage faster than previous generation Oneplus 7 Pro. The phone charges 0 to 70 percent in a jiffy of 20 minutes. The phone still lacking wireless charging which doesn&#8217;t bother me.</p>



<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>As usual, Oneplus continue to cherish in flagship territory with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Oneplus 7t (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oneplus.in/7t/specs?from=7t" target="_blank">Oneplus 7t</a>. It has every parameter of the flagship the fastest processor, impressive software, great display and better cameras. Though it still lacks some flagship capabilities like an IP rating, wireless charging, if we see the pricing its quite acceptable. The pricing is kept as same as Oneplus 7 8GB version which seems to be honest and aggressive. The phone is going on sale in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Amazon  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.in/b?node=18199392031&amp;pf_rd_p=1be0e160-26bb-4e17-9ffa-9263e1084b66&amp;pf_rd_r=RZ4G1Y2WKRV4XB3MC8YD" target="_blank">Amazon</a> great Indian festival starting 28th September with some assured discounts, seems to be a good pick and better value for money.</p>

<p>Today Xiaomi has upgraded their 3-month-old <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Redmi 7A (opens in a new tab)" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoredmi-7a-budget-killer/" target="_blank">Redmi 7A</a> by launching Redmi 8A with slightly refined design and specs. Here are my impressions</p>



<h2>Redmi 8A Specifications</h2>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>6.22 inches HD Plus LCD display with waterdrop style notch</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chipset</strong></td><td>Snapdragon 439</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ram and storage</strong></td><td>2/3 GB with 32 GB of storage and a dedicated slot supports upto 512 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td><strong><em>Rear</em></strong> &#8211;  12 MP AI camera<br><strong><em>Front</em></strong> &#8211; 8 MP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>5000 mAh with USB Type C Support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td>MIUI 10 based on Android v9.0 (pie)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Colours</strong></td><td>Blue, Black and Red</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>Rs. 6499 for 2 GB plus 32 GB<br>Rs. 6999 for 3 GB plus 32 GB </td></tr></tbody></table>



<h3><strong>Redmi 8A Impressions</strong></h3>



<p>The Redmi 8A has a single unibody plastic design with a Matte finish at the back. The power and volume rockers are well on the right side with charger port and 3.5 mm jack at the bottom.  Also, the phone still lacks a fingerprint sensor and rely on the insecure face unlock which is slightly let down.</p>



<p>The Redmi 8A has 6.22 inch HD plus display with gorilla glass 5 protection and a waterdrop style notch which is a slight upgrade over heavily criticized Redmi 7A&#8217;s 18:9 panel with thick bezels. There is p2i splash proof coating as well which is not normal in entry level phones</p>



<p>The Redmi 8A is running on the same processor as that of Redmi 7A which is octa-core snapdragon 439 SOC coupled with 2 or 3 GB of Ram. The processor is pretty much capable for entry-level users with casual social media usage and browsing.  There is FM support as well</p>



<p>The phone has 5000 MAH battery with USB type C support and it will be the first entry-level phone to bring USB type C support.</p>



<p>The Phone has a single 13 MP camera powered by Sony IMX 363 sensor with dual phase detection. It also has dedicated a night mode too. The front-facing one is 8 MP shooter</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall, the Redmi 8A is easy recommender in the entry-level segment with minor tweaks over the predecessor which can take over the likes of <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorealme-c2-a-better-one/">Realme C2</a>.   Xiaomi has made a proper checklist of what has to be present for entry-level smartphone. So they decided to go with a standard design, more battery and a capable entry-level chip inside. For pricing standards the Redmi 8A was well kept on par and nothing much difference over former. Am still unsure about the purpose behind this product refresh as the phone looks like a minimal refresh on the paper compared to Redmi 7A but as overall Redmi 8A seems to easily satisfy entry-level buyers. The phone is going on sale on Flipkart.com starting 30th September mid night</p>

<h3><strong>Design and Display</strong></h3>



<p>The Vivo V17 Pro is made up of glass panel and has 4 camera layout at the centre. This can manage the drop test, because of its gorilla glass v6 and glassy back panel of gorilla glass v5. The phone has rectangular popup at the front which houses 2 cameras and has full view gorgeous 6.44 inches FHD plus super AMOLED display added with Gorilla glass 6 protection. The phone has dedicated assistant button as well and hopefully, it can be customizable for other functions too. </p>



<h3><strong>Performance and Battery</strong></h3>



<p>This guy is running on snapdragon 675 with 8 gigs of ram and 128 GB of Storage. This is neither a bad chip nor too good but considering this price point I would say they could have opted for Snapdragon 730 series. But still, snapdragon 675 is a better chip in terms of CPU performance and I would say none of the manufacturers utilised the chip properly and always opted for Snapdragon 710/712 series keeping GPU in mind as Snapdragon 710/712 chip has better GPU performance. Also it worth to mention the past year Vivo V15 Pro was powered by same Snapdragon 675 which puts performance upgrade in question for this year.</p>



<p>The phone is running on the same mediocre Android pie based Vivo&#8217;s fun touch OS which does not seem to impress me any time. The phone has 4100 MAH battery with 18W fast charging.</p>



<h3><strong>Camera</strong></h3>



<p>The Vivo V17 Pro has a different position of camera setup(6 cameras) 48 MP for wide-angle that is the primary rear camera, 8 MP for ultrawide, 13 MP for the telephoto lens and 2 MP for depth sensor. With the upgraded camera set up, it has a dual pop up selfie cameras of 32 MP -wide and 32 MP &#8211; ultrawide. This phone 10 different modes for the camera and one would need to spend some time exploring the camera features. The Vivo V series phones were meant for the camera and this beast is not an exception in-camera performance.</p>



<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall the Vivo V17 Pro is a camera-centric solid phone with a better display, build and a capable peformance. For the price quoted it offers much on camera and if you are the user who is fondling for cameras then this phone may be a perfect choice or else if you are the casual user looking for the all-round package then there are still a lot of options to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Build, Design and Display</strong>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The back panel has a ROG symbol which has colour changeable LED that can be handled by the user(also adjust brightness). The phone has USB type C for charging and retains 3.5 mm jack which is much-needed addition. Also, you can get many accessories like joypad, dual-screen, etc. as an external attachment. The phone is made up of metal which has usual volume rockers and power buttons on the right side and an in-display fingerprint sensor. The device has well-placed antennas everywhere to make sure nothing blocks the signal reception while playing. There are bottom-firing dual speakers as well. The phone has 2 invisible touchpoints which can be triggered for gaming controls. Overall on paper, Asus ROG 2 is a well-built gamer-centric phone.</p>



<p>The Asus ROG 2 has 6.49 inch full HD plus 120 HZ Amoled panel with 19:9 aspect ratio with a minimal notch. The display is HDR certified but I would say resolution could have been taken further to Quad HD but still not a concern. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Performance</strong>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Asus ROG 2 uses Qualcomm snapdragon 855+ with Adreno 640 GPU which is the fastest chipset on Android at present. Even at a high frame rate, there would not be any lagging issues. The ROG phone 2 is running on Android pie 9.0 based ROG UI. The special software feature is that we can use the phone with ROG theme(Gaming theme) or change it to stock Android theme like in other Asus mobiles which is a great addition.</p>



<p>For high graphic games to prevent the phone from heating, Asus provides an external coolant fan that cools down the mobile.</p>



<h3><strong>Battery</strong></h3>



<p>It has a massive 6000 mAh battery which is more required for a gaming phone. Its coupled with 30W fast charger, but only 18W charger is given in the box. The good thing is that the phone has dual charging port where you can charge the phone even in the landscape while playing games</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The ROG 2 has dual (48 MP primary and 13 MP ultra-wide-angle) irregular shaped camera setup with dual-LED flash at the back which can help you take decent shots. The front camera is 24 MP one.</p>



<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Asus ROG phone 2 is a performance beast with complete specs package which completely satisfies mobile gamers. Its worth to mention this phone is meant for gamers and high graphic intense usage. If you are the causal user this phone may not be the right one to consider. At the price of Rs. 37999 this phone is going to be the flagship killer which will easily take on Xiaomi Black Shark 2(Gaming phone), Oneplus 7 series, upcoming Oneplus 7T series, Redmi K20 pro etc.</p>

<p>Since last year before the M series arrival, Samsung was meant to bring great phones with absurd pricing and could not able to balance the price vs specifications ratio. But Samsung had made the mobile industry to look back at them with online exclusive M series which is a pretty decent series to consider. In this lineup, last week Samsung had launched M30s the mid-range power brick in India as a successor to last year Samsung M30 starting at Rs. 13999. Here are my impressions</p>

<h3><strong>Samsung M30s Impressions</strong></h3>



<p>The phone has all-round complete plastic build with mono speaker, a 3.5mm jack and USB type C port at the bottom. The buttons are well placed on the usual right-hand side and have over polished fingerprint sensor placed at the back. The back of the phone has a big camera bump housing triple camera setup and a flash.  Overall the phone is built quite similar to the predecessor Samsung M30. Next, the phone has 6.4 inches super AMOLED Infinity U display and none can beat the Samsung in display segment as they are making displays even for big giants like Apple, etc. </p>



<p>From the performance side, the phone is running on the Exynos 9611 chip which is a minor upgrade from previous generation Exynos 9610. There is nothing much change in CPU but Samsung claims there is an improvement in GPU performance. From the software side, it&#8217;s running on Android Pie-based One UI. In recent times it worth to mention one UI is doing good on the software side compared to other custom UI&#8217;s. So to conclude we can say that the Samsung M30s is a capable daily performer without any hiccups at this price point. </p>



<p>For the battery department, the Samsung M30s is having massive 6000 MAH battery with 15W fast charging and I can say that phone easily gives 2-day power for casual users. A Big kudos to Samsung for making a huge leap in the battery segment and it will be the first non-tablet phone to house a 6000 MAH inside the box.</p>



<p>Samsung M30s has triple camera setup with the primary one as usual 48 MP sensor, 5 MP depth camera, and 8 MP ultra-wide-angle camera. For selfies, it has 16 MP one. </p>



<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall the Samsung M30s is a solid recommender for the starting price Rs. 13999. The device is going on sale at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="amazon.in (opens in a new tab)" href="http://amazon.in" target="_blank">amazon.in</a> during Great Indian Sale which is definitely a good pick. Finally, Samsung is once again back in the game with Samsung M30s with aggressive pricing and great specs in the box.</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>



<p>The Moto E6s has a gloss finish at the back but it&#8217;s completely made of plastic at both sides. The back panel is removable and houses a removable 3000 MAH battery plus 2 sim cards Micro and nano along with dedicated SD card slot. Moto has said the back panel has more interchangeable colours panels which will be announced soon. There is a fingerprint reader engraved into the Moto logo at the back as well. Overall from ergonomics, Moto should have been applauded as the device is light, well built and comfortable phone to hold from what it looks</p>



<p>The Moto E6s has 6.1 inch HD plus max vision LCD display with minimal bezels at the bottom with waterdrop style notch at the top. The top highlight was the performance, the phone was running on Mediatek Helio P22 processor with 4 GB of Ram. Thought SOC is dated but it&#8217;s running on the stock android without any bloatware which makes performance above par in this price point.</p>



<p>For Camera, the Moto E6s has dual 13 MP primary plus 2 MP depth camera at the back and standard 8 MP shooter at the front. This is not the right budget to talk about the camera so it&#8217;s better to accept as it is. The battery was a big downgrade as Moto E series in the past had massive batteries but still, moto has said this 3000 MAH battery was tweaked with box charger to provide quick charging time.</p>



<p>Overall, the Moto E6s is easy recommender in sub 8K segment. </p>

<p>Realme is trying hard to take over the Xiaomi by launching new phones every month. They gently making incremental upgrades over the phones and keep on pushing to the market. I am pretty much impressed over the market figures and community they had developed so far. I would say they are growing very fast in recent times. In this way a few days back they had dropped Realme XT a new value champ in the mid-range segment with tons of fully loaded specifications for the asking price of Rs. 15999. Let&#8217;s have a look at my thoughts on the same.</p>

<h3><em><strong>Impressions</strong></em></h3>



<h3><strong>Realme XT </strong><em><strong>Design, Build and Display</strong></em></h3>



<p>There is nothing much change in the design side as Realme XT has a hyperbolic pattern at the black with quad-camera setup at the back. The phone has all buttons were placed on the usual side. It&#8217;s available in 2 colors Pearl Blue and Pearl White. It has a 6.4 inch super AMOLED panel which is a slight reduction in size than the previous Realme X but still one of the best panels in this price point to consider. For viewing the phone still has waterdrop style notch than the former Realme X which has popup display without any notch. </p>



<p>The phone has dual corning gorilla glass at the front and 3D curved back which is a nice addition. The phone has an in-display fingerprint scanner which was made by Goodix. Finally, Realme has decided to give up the plastic body at least in Realme XT. In recent times, I would say the Realme is carrying the same design pattern which makes me feel dull and am looking for a major refresh at least in the next product. Overall I would say for this price point Realme XT is well designed and has a good display.</p>



<h3><strong>Realme XT </strong><em><strong>Performance, Software, and Battery</strong></em></h3>



<p style="text-align:left">The Realme XT is powered by snapdragon 712 AIE which is pretty solid for heavy gaming and day to day tasks. The phone is 10 percent faster than the previous generation snapdragon 712 and it won&#8217;t make significant changes in benchmarks and daily usage. From the software side, the device is running Color OS 6.0 based on Android pie 9.0 and in short words am not a fan of Realme software. Hopefully Realme soon going to publish Realme OS Soon and expecting it to impress me.</p>



<p>For the battery, this guy has 4000 MAH battery with VOOC 3.0 flash charge support where Realme claims the phone will charge from 0 &#8211; 52 % in 30 mins. The good thing is the phone ships with a 20W charger in the box.</p>



<h3><strong>Realme XT </strong><em><strong>Camera</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Realme XT has quad-camera setup in which primary one is world&#8217;s first ever 64 MP camera which has Samsung GW1 sensor and using this we can take photos and print up to poster size photos for wall hanging. Other sensors include an 8 MP 115-degree Ultra Wide-angle camera for capture better details plus 2 MP depth sensor and 2 MP dedicated macro camera which is an excellent addition at this price point. The front camera is 16 MP Sony sensor. For video standpoint, the phone will support Full HD videos at 30, 60 FPS and 4k at 30 FPS with EIS support.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Realme&#8217;s Confusing Strategy??</em></strong></h3>



<p>There was a bit controversial across social media was addressed by CEO Madhav Seth like does Realme is launching too many products? The answer told by him was the Realme is trying to give too many options not too many phones and Realme is one of the companies which always try to give their best to end consumers says Madhav. The answer can be quite acceptable for the manufactures but not for the end consumers. Imagine as normal consumer if a buy a phone this month and within a month what if a phone comes slightly better upgrades at almost similar pricing. But it&#8217;s quite obvious in consumer electronics but refresh rate for new products looks quite faster in terms of Realme. It&#8217;s Just my 2 cents on Realme&#8217;s Strategy.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What&#8217;s Next?</em></strong></h3>



<p>Realme is the only company which reveals what&#8217;s in their works before finishing the presentation. So in the Queue, Madhav Seth CEO of Realme has confirmed Realme XT 730G is in works for the restless gamers and it will be coming in December. Below are the highlights. <br><br>For more visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="NDTV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/realme-xt-730g-india-launch-december-snapdragon-64-megapixel-quad-camera-2100387" target="_blank">NDTV</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/thoughtsqre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Realme-XT-730G.jpg?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/thoughtsqre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Realme-XT-730G-1.jpg?w=825&#038;ssl=1" alt="Realme XT 730G" class="wp-image-1861" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thoughtsqre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Realme-XT-730G-1.jpg?w=921&amp;ssl=1 921w, https://i2.wp.com/thoughtsqre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Realme-XT-730G-1.jpg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/thoughtsqre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Realme-XT-730G-1.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Realme XT 730G</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong><em>Verdict</em></strong></h3>



<p>So overall at least in the paper, I won&#8217;t see any compliance with Realme XT and this is the best phone in the sub 20 K phone to consider. No other brands offer an 8 GB Ram version at Rs. 18999 and also other versions pricing are well being kept at par with industry standards for specifications offered. The phone is available from 16th September on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Flipkart (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.flipkart.com/realme-xt-pearl-blue-128-gb/p/itm731360fdbd273?pid=MOBFJYBEHKJFKZDK&amp;lid=LSTMOBFJYBEHKJFKZDKWN8OCX&amp;marketplace=FLIPKART&amp;sattr[]=color&amp;sattr[]=storage&amp;sattr[]=ram&amp;st=storage&amp;otracker=search" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>. </p>

<h2><strong>Lenovo Z6 Pro Impressions</strong></h2>



<h3><strong><em>Build, Design and Display</em></strong></h3>



<p>The Z6 Pro is made up of dual corning glass at the back and front. It has Quad camera layout at the back with Volume rockers and power button at the right side. There&#8217;s a tiny dewdrop notch housing 32 MP selfie camera. All the charger grill, 3.5 mm jack and speakers were well placed at the bottom of the phone. </p>



<p>The Lenovo Z6 Pro has 3D Gradient Red and Black pattern at the back and unfortunately, there is an only one black variant was launched in India rather bluish-green variant is missed out unlike global.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Z6 Pro has 6.34 inch HDR 10 certified Amoled panel with 6th generation optical in Display fingerprint sensor for security. Lenovo has few gimmicks like Eye Protection mode and Highlight mode for display marketing. The display is almost full view and has tiny acceptable notch and i wont any troublesome in terms of viewing experience.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Performance, Software and Battery</em></strong></h3>



<p>The Lenovo Z6 Pro is running on the Snapdragon 855 processor and uses cold front cooling technology to cool down the phone when there is a rise in temperature during heavy tasks. Lenovo claims the phone will be 8-degree Celcius cooler while playing heavy games. So the performance side won&#8217;t have any compliance at least on paper. </p>



<p>This guy is running on Android 9 Pie-based Zen UI almost close to stock android with guaranteed security updates claims Lenovo Moto as usual by words. Though the phone UI looks close to stock android still notification shade looks like third party launcher stuff and am not much impressed with the same. So from the software front just for words, we can say its running stock android but still, Lenovo moto has poor update track which is worth to mention here.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Z6 Pro is powered by 4000 mah battery with 27 W fast charging support.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Camera</em></strong></h3>



<p>The Lenovo Z6 Pro is sporting a Quad Camera setup at the back with primary traditional 48 MP Quad Pixel binned Sony IMX 586 sensor plus 16 Mp ultra-wide-angle camera with 125-degree field of view along with 8 MP telephoto camera which supports 4x Optical Zoom and 2 Mp dedicated Macro Camera for close up shots. The major highlight according to Lenovo was video log which combines both front and rear camera shots in a video coverage. Out of 4 camera, 3 will support 4k recording. For video stabilisation, Lenovo Z6 pro supports hyper video for high-quality videos and has hybrid stabilisation from both software and hardware. From what Lenovo showcased at the launch the phone is better in taking steady shots and much stabilised videos</p>

<h3><strong><em>Verdict</em></strong></h3>



<p>For the price of solo 8 GB plus 128 GB variant at Rs. 33999, the Lenovo has clear plans to take out the value flagships in this price point but for comeback phone, I would say the price could have been little aggressive. The Lenovo Z6 Pro will face stiff competition from Redmi K20 Pro, Oneplus 7, Asus 6Z with all the phones are being stacked at the around same price point and packs similar features. The software still is a big question to me and still unsure how Lenovo plans to resolve the same considering the past. So Lenovo Z6 Pro is not an easy device to step out and sure be another option to be considered while thinking about valued flagships but does this stand up against the major competitors is still be a question in terms of brand value.</p>

<p>Its big day for Apple as they dropped not one but 3 iPhones for this year 2019. Last year they had brought iPhone XS, XS max and much lower-priced iPhone XR according to apple. The last year models were heavily criticised for extortionate pricing and this year is not an exception. Despite heavy pricing, iPhone XR is doing a tremendous job after the price cut. The new iPhones have come with much more improved cameras and incremental bionic chip upgrade with a typical apple price tag. Apple has named them as iPhone 11, Pro and Pro Max. Let&#8217;s see what the pro models packed inside!</p>



<h3><strong>Specifications</strong></h3>

<h3><em><strong>iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max Impressions</strong></em></h3>



<p>Both the phones carry the same build pattern made up of glass with stainless steel coating and have water and dust resistant. Apple claims the iPhone glass is the toughest one to break. Both the iPhone&#8217;s display is OLED panels with smaller Pro has 5.8 inches screen and larger brother Pro max has 6.5 inches screen. Both the iPhone&#8217;s display is HDR certified.</p>



<p>These guys are running on A13 Bionic chip and it&#8217;s the fastest CPU and GPU in the world to beat and Apple claims they had improved batteries by 4 hours and 5 hours than the previous year XS and XS max respectively. Both the iPhones have triple 12 MP camera setup featuring standard, telephoto and a wide-angle lens with dedicated improved flash to assist in dark.  The front-facing one is also 12 MP resolution true depth camera. For videography, all the 3 rear cameras support 4k at 60 fps including OIS support for wide-angle and telephoto lens. I would say Apple videography sound and stabilisation is still the one to beat over the years. Other photography features include dedicated night mode, slowfies were introduced for the sake of innovation.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Verdict</em></strong></h3>



<p>For the asking price of Rs. 99900 for Pro and Rs. 109000 for Pro Max, the device will definitely take over the 2019 flagships but pricing is still absurd and not so much aggressive as like iPhone 11. I would say consumers can pick the smaller son iPhone 11 and some features like fast charging and the extra telephoto camera can be sacrificed for pricing if you are Apple fanboy.</p>

<p>Its big day for Apple as they dropped not one but 3 iPhones for this year 2019. Last year they had brought iPhone XS, XS max and much lower-priced iPhone XR according to apple. The last year models were heavily criticised for extortionate pricing and this year is not an exception. Despite heavy pricing, iPhone XR announced in 2018 is doing a tremendous job after the price cut and Apple has announced furthermore today. The new generation 2019 iPhones have come with much more improved cameras and incremental bionic chip upgrade carrying a typical apple price tag. Apple has named them as iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Here are my impressions on entry-level iPhone 11 for 2019.</p>



<h3><strong>Specifications</strong></h3>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Front and back glass <br>Water and dust resistant</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>6.11-inch Retina LCD display with 326 PPI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>A13 bionic with 8-bit Neural engine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td>ios 13</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ram </strong></td><td>4 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>1 hour more than iPhone XR &#8211; 3110 MAH<br>18W fast charging supported but need to get separately <br>Supports wireless charging</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td>12 MP  f 1.8 Primary Camera <br>12 Mp  f 2.4 Ultra wide-angle  <br>camera with 120-degree field of view<br>Supports 2X optical Zoom and 5x Digital Zoom<br><br>12 Mp f 2.2 true depth <strong>selfie </strong>camera</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video</strong></td><td><strong>Rear </strong>&#8211; 4k at 60 fps for both cameras<br><strong>Front </strong>&#8211; 4k at 30 fps; supports slow-mo selfies(slowfies)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Colours</strong></td><td>Purple, White, Red, Yellow, Black, Green</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td>Rs. 64900 for 64 GB <br>Rs. 69900 for 128 GB<br>Rs. 79900 for 256 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Others</strong></td><td>Dual Sim(Physical + eSim)<br>Stereo Speakers<br>Faster Face recognition</td></tr></tbody></table>



<h3><strong>iPhone 11 Impressions</strong></h3>



<p>From the design phase, the front panel exactly resembles iPhone XR and at the back, it houses a dual-camera system and a flash. Apple has made quite a lot of improvements in iPhone 2019 series finally they bring the Night mode and fast charging to 2019 iPhones for the word of innovation. Other noticeable changes include a dual-camera system with 4K support and slow-motion selfies. From a performance standpoint, A13 is the miles ahead and nearly 30 to 40% faster than Snapdragon 855 and it will be a phone with the fastest CPU and GPU in the world. </p>



<p>For the starting price of Rs. 64900 it&#8217;s not about worth or not as Apple products are always targetted for richer people. But I would say Apple had learnt from the mistakes made in the past for at least in the markets like India and came with a bang with definitely impress crazy Apple fans.</p>
